The above provided link is a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. 
A detailing information report about their employees across various teams are shown using python programming. 
Preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting information graphically are included.
    Importing of employee_dataset.csv was done as the first process. Set of sample data , explanation and null value sets are printed using first set of code.
    Changed the values of height column using numpy random.randint, and those were printed.

Bar Diagram representation are given for each tasks given.
A bar plot is used as it is easy to read and interpret.
It can easily handle large amount of data.
In Task 1, Distribution of Employees Across Teams, the New Orleans Pelicans have the highest number of employees, while the Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic have the fewest.
In Task 2, Employee Segragation by Position, SG has the highest percentage, followed closely by PF. C has the least precentage.
